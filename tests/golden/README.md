# Golden baselines

These files describe what the renderer produced. They never contain it.

The frames this port renders are Def Jam: Fight for NY's own artwork, and this repository is public, so a
baseline here stores only measurements: the bounding box of the drawn region, how many pixels and distinct
colours it has, and a hash. That is enough to catch a regression from "renders the screen" to "renders
nothing", or to something structurally different, which is what the L4 row of `docs/02-test-plan.md` asks
for. Actual captures land in `logs/`, which is gitignored.

Produce a capture by running the game with the host's back-buffer grab enabled:

```
$env:RECOMP_PB_D3D11=1; $env:RECOMP_GAMMA=0; $env:RECOMP_TRANS_SHOT="$PWD\logs\frame.bmp"; $env:RECOMP_TRANS_SHOT_FRAME=150
.\scripts\run.ps1 -TimeoutSecs 60
python scripts\frame-signature.py logs\frame.bmp --check tests\golden\m2-loading-screen.json
```

`RECOMP_GAMMA=0` since 2026-10-02: captures now carry the title's gamma ramp, and the goldens were taken
before it was applied.

The M2 signature was rewritten on 2026-10-02 (patch 0106): the logo is drawn with the linear filter the title
asks for, where it had been point-sampled.

Frame 150 since 2026-09-29: start-up got faster (the PTIMER and vsync fixes, 0071 and 0074), and frame 900
now lands in the intro movie. Frames 150-160 hold the loading screen; the golden itself is unchanged.

`RECOMP_TRANS_SHOT_FRAME` matters: the first frames are a clear and nothing else, because the title is still
loading, so a capture of frame zero is black no matter how well the renderer works. It takes a list
(`30,3600`), one file per frame with the number before the extension.

For screens reached with `RECOMP_PAD_SCRIPT`, aim by time instead: `RECOMP_TRANS_SHOT_SECS=200,230` takes
the first frame after each point in seconds since process start, the clock the pad script uses, and names the
files `<stem>-200s.bmp`. Frame counts drift by hundreds between runs, so a frame number cannot be aimed at
the screen a scripted press leads to.

Even seconds since process start drift by a minute (the title appears anywhere from 100 to 190 s), so
anchor the clock to the title instead: `RECOMP_SCRIPT_ANCHOR=feflow.xml#2` starts both the pad script's
and the capture's clock at the second open of `screens\feflow.xml`, which is the title loading after the
intro. The main-menu capture:

```
$env:RECOMP_SCRIPT_ANCHOR="feflow.xml#2"; $env:RECOMP_TRANS_SHOT="$PWD\logs\menu.bmp"; $env:RECOMP_TRANS_SHOT_SECS=50
$env:RECOMP_PAD_SCRIPT="start:8:8.4,start:11:11.4,a:14:14.3,a:18:18.3,a:22:22.3,a:26:26.3,a:30:30.3,a:34:34.3,a:38:38.3,b:42:42.3,b:46:46.3"
.\scripts\run.ps1 -TimeoutSecs 280
python scripts\frame-signature.py logs\menu-50s.bmp --check tests\golden\m4a-main-menu.json
```

START twice (the title ignores the first press now and then), A until both memory-card popups have gone
(they ignore input for a varying 5–15 s), then B twice: the As that land after the popups choose Story, which
opens the user-ID screen and sometimes its keyboard, and each B backs out one level to the main menu.

| Baseline | What it is |
|---|---|
| `m2-loading-screen.json` | The game's first loading screen — crest logo and LOADING wordmark, centred, on black. The first screen this port has ever rendered, and the same screen xemu reaches before it freezes. |
| `m3-title-screen.json` | The title screen: skyline, logo, "Press START", copyright. Capture it 5 s after the anchor (`RECOMP_SCRIPT_ANCHOR=feflow.xml#2`, `RECOMP_TRANS_SHOT_SECS=5`); frame 3,600 used to land on it but now and then lands on a black transition instead. |
| `m4a-main-menu.json` | The main menu, idle, captured as above: "MAIN MENU" header, the eight mode tiles, the Story panel. Loose by design (region and drawn-pixel count within 5%): it also accepts the menu with another tile selected and the match-type screen, and rejects the title. |

## Checking all three

`python scripts/regress.py --only m2,m3,m4a` runs the game three times and checks each signature. The
loading screen (M2) has no front-end call to anchor a capture on, and which frame it is on depends on how
fast the build starts, so that check captures several frames and passes if one of them is the screen.

## fight-stream.json

The SHA-256 of the game-state stream of the first 1,800 simulation steps of a One on One whose
input is step-timed and whose random seeds are pinned (`scripts/regress.py --only replay`). It was
identical on the Release and Debug builds and on two save fixtures. It is a hash of derived state;
no game data is stored. Update it with `--only repeat --update-golden` when a change is meant to
alter how the fight plays, and say so in the commit.
