.SYNOPSIS  Boot smoke test: runs the recompiled game for N seconds and grades how far it got.
.OUTPUTS   Exit code = highest stage reached (0..4). Stages are cumulative log markers printed by src/main.c
           and the xboxrecomp runtime. Extend $stages as bring-up progresses.
  S0  process started, XBE loaded
  S1  memory layout + kernel init complete   ("=== Initialization complete ===")
  S2  guest entry called, no crash in first 5 s ("Starting game..." and no "EXCEPTION"/"ACCESS_VIOLATION")
  S3  D3D device created (runtime log)         (first frame presented)
  S4  ran the full timeout without crash/hang  (watchdog silent)
