/**
 * Manual function overrides and ICALL diagnostics
 *
 * This file provides:
 *   - recomp_lookup_manual()  : intercept specific Xbox VAs with hand-written code
 *   - recomp_icall_fail_log() : log when an indirect call target can't be resolved
 *   - ICALL trace ring buffer  : globals used by the RECOMP_ICALL macro
 *
 * The recomp pipeline generates an auto-dispatch table (recomp_lookup) that
 * resolves most function addresses. recomp_lookup_manual() is called FIRST,
 * giving you a chance to override any function with a custom implementation.
 *
 * Common reasons to add manual overrides:
 *   - Trace a function to understand call flow (wrap the generated version)
 *   - Fix a function the lifter translated incorrectly
 *   - Stub out a function that crashes (return early, set eax to a safe value)
 *   - Redirect a function to a native implementation (e.g., skip CRT init)
 *   - Intercept D3D/audio calls for custom rendering or sound

 *   [ICALL] Failed to resolve VA 0x00201954

 * `rep movsd` still copied the aligned bulk, so most calls looked fine
 * and only the head/tail bytes were dropped. A pointer copied by one of
 * those calls came out half-written, which is where the null indirect
 * calls that followed came from.
 *
 * Reimplementing it natively is both the fix and a large speed-up; the
 * original is cdecl, returns the destination in eax, and handles

/* ---- A wrapper that does not wrap -------------------------------------
 *
 * Two attempts lived here: `_gen` wrappers on 0x00197650 and 0x0019B0C0, to
 * find out whether the front-end constructor ran and what its allocation
 * returned. Neither ever printed anything, and the reason is worth keeping.
 *
 * Declaring `extern void sub_X_gen(void);` does emit the real body under that
 * name -- and it also rewrites every direct call site to call `sub_X_gen`
 * instead. So a direct caller goes straight to the original body and the
 * wrapper is never on the path. It only intercepts calls that arrive through
 * recomp_lookup_manual(), which sees indirect calls only. The sleep trace
 * below works for exactly that reason: its target is reached through a
 * function pointer.
 *
 * To trace a function with direct callers, either replace it outright (define
 * it here without the `_gen` declaration and implement the behaviour), or put
 * a hardware watchpoint on something it writes -- src/hooks/watchpoint.c, and
 * scripts/guest-stack.py to read the call chain once it fires.

 * running and it is waiting for something in a poll-and-sleep loop.
 *
 * Which code is the question this answers. The shim is reached through a
 * function pointer, so recomp_lookup_manual() can intercept it without the

 * return address, which names the call site exactly. Then the real body runs,
 * so behaviour is unchanged.
