/*
 * Notice when the title writes over its own code.
 *
 * Nothing should ever write to an executable section. When something does,
 * what breaks is whatever happens to live there, and it breaks much later and
 * somewhere else: a switch whose jump table has been overwritten tail-jumps to
 * a byte of a string and the title falls over three functions away, with
 * nothing at the scene to say why. That has happened twice here -- once over
 * the jump table at guest 0x00077158, once over the main thread block -- and
 * both times the cause was found only because the address was known in advance
 * and could be watched. The debug registers watch four addresses; this watches
 * every executable byte in the image.
 *
 * It keeps a copy of each executable section and compares on a timer, which is
 * a sampling detector: it reports that a word changed and when it was noticed,
 * not the instruction that changed it. That is still most of the answer,
 * because the address is what a RECOMP_WATCH_WRITE needs to name the writer,
 * and finding the address is the part that costs a day.
 *
 *     $env:RECOMP_GUARD_CODE="1"        guard every executable section
 *     $env:RECOMP_GUARD_MS="250"        how often to compare (default 500)
 *
 * Why this matters in a static recompilation, where it might look as though
 * it should not: overwriting guest code is harmless here, because the code
 * that runs is compiled C and no longer reads those bytes. What is not
 * harmless is the DATA that lives in an executable section -- above all the
 * jump tables, which the lifted code does read at run time, once per switch.
 * A corrupted jump table is a switch that jumps to a byte of a string. So
 * the reports worth acting on are the ones that land on data, and reports
 * that land on instruction bytes can be noted and set aside.
 *
 * For the same reason there are false positives that are not bugs at all: an
 * XBE section marked executable holds both code and writable data, and a
 * title writing its own statics there is behaving normally. Expect noise,
 * and read the addresses rather than the count.
 *
 * The sections come from the image's own headers, read out of guest memory
 * rather than assumed, so a title whose code does not start where this one's
 * does is handled without a change here.
