/*
 * The few NV2A register blocks that cannot be plain memory.
 *
 * The title's Direct3D is statically linked into the XBE, so it drives the
 * GPU's registers itself rather than going through anything this runtime
 * provides. Nearly all of that works against the zeroed memory the runtime
 * maps at 0xFD000000, because nearly all of it is state the title writes and
 * reads back. Two kinds of register are not:
 *
 *   - one whose bit the hardware clears when an operation finishes, and
 *   - one that counts on its own.
 *
 * Both hang a title that waits on them. This file traps the pages they live on
 * and models just those registers; everything else on the trapped pages keeps
 * whatever is written to it, exactly as the memory did.
 *
 * ── 0xFD100000, PFB: the write-back-cache flush ────────────────────────────
 *
 *     0x0021EA89   mov  ecx, [eax+0x100410]     ; NV_PFB_WBC
 *                  or   ecx, 0x10000            ; NV_PFB_WBC_FLUSH
 *                  mov  [eax+0x100410], ecx     ; ask for the flush
 *     0x0021EAB0   test dword ptr [eax+0x100410], 0x10000
 *                  jne  0x0021EAB0              ; spin until it completes
 *
 * `eax` is 0xFD000000, read out of the device object, so this is 0xFD100410.
 * Hardware clears FLUSH when the cache has been written back. Against memory
 * the bit stays set and the main thread never leaves the loop. There is no
 * cache here to write back, so the honest answer is that the flush is already
 * done: the bit reads back clear.
 *
 * The symptom was easy to misread, which is worth recording. The rendering
 * thread is a different thread, so it kept resubmitting the frame it already
 * had: the loading screen stayed up and kept animating while the thread that
 * would advance the game was wedged in a two-instruction loop.
 *
 * ── 0xFD009000, PTIMER: the free-running clock ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * PTIMER counts continuously on hardware and is read as a 56-bit tick count
 * through TIME_0 and TIME_1. Against zeroed memory it reads zero forever, so
 * any "wait until the clock has advanced" is a hang, and any elapsed-time
 * calculation is zero. This is also the block xemu's open issue for this title
 * (#1124, "an unsupported PTimer operation") points at, so what the title does
 * with it is worth knowing regardless of whether it is our blocker.
 *
 * The counter here is derived from the host's performance counter, scaled by
 * the numerator and denominator the title programs, which is how the hardware
 * defines the rate. Reads are counted so a run can answer the prior question:
 * does this title read the clock at all, or only disable its interrupt?
 *
 * PFIFO's push-buffer pointers at 0xFD003000, which the title drives every
 * frame, are on another page and stay plain memory. PGRAPH at 0xFD400000 is
 * trapped for its write-1-to-clear interrupt status (see nv2a_regs_init).
