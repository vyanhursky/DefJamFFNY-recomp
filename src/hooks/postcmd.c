/*
 * Post a synthetic command to the front end, to find out what the front end
 * would have done if anything had ever posted one.
 *
 * The title's front-end loop at guest 0x0019AB60 is healthy and idle. Its two
 * early gates are open (0x3B808C and 0x3B8090 both read zero), both of its
 * manager objects hold valid pointers, and it is parked on its third test:
 *
 *     if (MEM32(0x2EB73C) == 0) idle
 *
 * Nothing in the lifted image ever writes that pointer to a non-null value, so
 * the title sits there for ever and never loads its first screen. Reading
 * outwards from the loop has not found the poster, and there is a second
 * question worth answering on its own: whether the dispatch behind that
 * pointer still works at all. If the loop is fed a command and does nothing,
 * the damage is deeper than a missing post; if it is fed a command and starts
 * loading a screen, then the machinery is intact and only the trigger is
 * missing -- which is a much smaller thing to go looking for.
 *
 * The loop reads the command id from MEM32(ptr + 8), subtracts one, rejects
 * anything above 0x1E and otherwise dispatches through a 31-entry jump table.
 * So a command is a small structure whose only field this code needs to know
 * about is the id at +8. The rest is left zero, which is a real limitation:
 * a handler that dereferences another field will be reading zeros, and that
 * is a plausible way to crash. It is behind an environment variable and it is
 * a diagnostic, not a fix.
 *
 *     $env:RECOMP_POST_CMD="7"        post command id 7, once
 *     $env:RECOMP_POST_CMD="sweep"    post 1..31 in turn, pausing between
 *     $env:RECOMP_POST_CMD_MS="25000" how long to wait first (default 25s)
 *     $env:RECOMP_POST_CMD_STEP="2500" pause between ids in a sweep
 *
 * A sweep is the useful mode: a command that loads a screen has to open a
 * file to do it, and file opens are already logged, so the id that means
 * "load a screen" announces itself in the log next to the [POST] line that
 * caused it.
 *
 * The structure is placed high in the contiguous window, well above anything
 * the title's allocator hands out -- it starts at 0x80001000 and the addresses
 * seen in practice are five digits, so the top of the window is not in use.
 * The pointer is only written when it is already null, so a real command, if
 * one ever appears, is never overwritten.
