.SYNOPSIS  Save what the game's window is showing right now as a PNG.
.DESCRIPTION
  The harness's captures are read from the back buffer before presentation. This grabs the
  window's client area off the screen instead, so it shows what the player sees: use it to
  check anything applied at presentation (the gamma ramp, scaling). The window must be
  visible and not covered. The PNG is the game's artwork: keep it under logs/, never commit it.
.EXAMPLE   .\scripts\window-shot.ps1 -Out logs\shots\window.png
